# memory-bench

Per-question results and verification scripts for a controlled comparison of agent-memory
architectures: **files the model curates**, an **auto-mined structured store**, and a **trained
experience bank**.

This repository exists because published memory numbers are hard to compare. One system's LoCoMo
result has appeared as **84**, **58.44** and **75.14**: Zep reported 84; mem0's CTO
[filed an issue](https://github.com/getzep/zep-papers/issues/5) arguing the correct figure was
58.44 (the adversarial category counted in the numerator but excluded from the denominator); Zep
[re-ran with the error fixed and reported 75.14](https://blog.getzep.com/lies-damn-lies-statistics-is-mem0-really-sota-in-agent-memory/),
noting mem0's own number has been [cited at both 67 and 92.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19413).
One benchmark, one system, a 25-point spread, and the memory architecture never changed. Two more
habits compound it: **retrieval recall and answer accuracy quoted side by side** as if they
measured the same thing, and **the reader and judge behind a figure left unstated**, though
swapping the reader-and-judge stack moves a score by
[more than the architecture does](#store-only-head-to-head). A number published without its frame
cannot be checked, only believed.

So the aim here is narrow: **publish the evidence, not the conclusions.** The per-question rows
behind the tables in
[*The Shapes of Agent Memory*](https://pinglin.tw/blog/the-shapes-of-agent-memory) are committed,
with a script that recomputes each row-backed figure and fails loudly on any mismatch; the few
published scores whose rows could not be released are listed by the verifier itself, with
reasons. A reader can re-tally the scores, inspect answers against gold, re-run the statistics
under different assumptions, or discover that a number is wrong, which has already happened twice
and is recorded rather than quietly fixed.

## TL;DR

The same findings as the post, each with the figure it rests on and the section that rebuilds it.

- **The structured store beats files on accuracy and on measured chat tokens at once.** +28.7
  points on held-out LongMemEval-S questions (0.7361 against 0.4491, post-stratified), at 19.3k
  chat tokens per question against 286.5k. The token comparison covers reported prompt-plus-
  completion tokens only: embedder tokens are a separate currency (107.8k per question), and
  hidden reasoning, per-token prices, latency and infrastructure are not priced here.
  [Details](#longmemeval-s-held-out)
- **Files win where the right answer is "I don't know".** Abstention 0.889 against 0.778, and the
  equivalent LoCoMo category 0.508 against 0.246: eager retrieval needs an abstention discipline
  that sparse memory gets for free. [Details](#locomo)
- **Against interest: the hybrid is statistically indistinguishable from a plain vector index**
  on LoCoMo (+0.3 points, paired CI95 [-1.8, +2.4]): no detectable gain there, though the
  interval allows small effects either way. On the long-haystack benchmark the same pair
  separates: hybrid 0.750 against 0.600 on one pre-drawn sample, p = 0.008. That compares the two
  implementations end to end, retrieval fusion and reranking included, so it supports "this
  hybrid beats this flat store at long histories", not a clean mechanism claim. No single
  benchmark ranks memory systems. [Details](#longmemeval-m)
- **The ruler can outweigh the architecture.** Identical retrieval evaluated by a `gpt-4o-mini`
  reader-and-judge stack instead of the local 35B doing both scores 0.7825 against 0.7130. Both roles
  change together, so this measures the evaluation stack, not the reader alone; either way it is a
  bigger move than any difference between the three stores that work on LoCoMo (0.3 to 3.6 points),
  while on long-haystack LongMemEval-M the same store pair separates by 15. Which factor dominates
  depends on the benchmark, and numbers do not travel across protocols.
  [Details](#store-only-head-to-head)
- **On agentic benchmarks, memory paid only where the actor had headroom.** Real points for a
  weak actor (WebShop success +4.2, the agentic benchmarks' only significant memory-ablation
  effect), no detectable effect at the frontier, and a bar that only training reaches: the trained
  system's own released bank, injected into its own frozen actor, does not help it under either
  metric. Two actor tiers on two tasks make this an observed pattern, not a law.

## What was measured

One fixed open-weight model ([`Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-mxfp4`](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-mxfp4),
temperature 0) answers long-term-memory benchmarks through one shared minimal agent loop. Only
the memory layer changes between arms.

Architectures are named by what they do, not by who ships them: **file-based**, **place-organized**,
**entity-and-time**, and **hybrid** (place plus time). Where a named system is measured, it is named
and linked, and the description is drawn from its own documentation.

| Arm | Write path | Read path | What it is there to establish |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **No-memory** | Nothing is stored | Nothing is retrieved | The floor. Sizes how much of each score is memory rather than the model, and proves refusing everything cannot game the judge. |
| **File-based** | An LLM curates a `MEMORY.md` index plus topic files | Index in context, then grep and read | One of the two architectures under test: memory as files the model decides what to write. |
| **Structured** | Atomic dated facts, embedded, no LLM on the write path | Ranked hybrid search | The other: memory as a store that keeps everything and ranks at read time. |
| **Oracle** | The file-based arm's store, unchanged | The entire memory directory in context, no tools | Splits the file-based arm's losses in two. With its whole store in context nothing saved can be missed, so what it still gets wrong was never written down, and what it recovers was saved but not found. |

Two of these arms were built for this study, so they are specified here rather than drawn from
anyone's documentation:

- **Structured (the hybrid).** A place-organized write path files dated atomic facts with no LLM
  at ingest; validity windows, borrowed from the entity-and-time lineage, let a new fact close an
  old one's rather than compete with it at recall; and an associative graph learned from which
  places co-occur in retrievals beyond chance lets recall reach items the query never ranked. The
  place-plus-time combination is not unique
  ([MemPalace](https://github.com/mempalace/mempalace) ships validity windows too); the
  usage-learned layer is what differs. It deliberately omits the graph lineage's expensive half:
  no LLM at ingest, so no entity resolution and no maintained summaries.
- **File-based.** A reconstruction of a shipping coding agent's auto-memory (a `MEMORY.md` index
  over model-curated topic files), not a reimplementation written to lose. The original is
  closed-source, so [`systems/file-based/`](systems/file-based) publishes the per-claim sourced
  survey it is built from, the mechanism itself, its tests, and a toy chatbot that runs the loop
  live, plus an open envelope check for anyone with the real tool to falsify it.

The judge is identical across arms: a model judge plus a deterministic pass that re-classifies
refusals, so "I don't know" scores correct only when the answer genuinely was not in the history.

## Results

### LongMemEval-S, held out

[`scripts/longmemeval_s.py`](scripts/longmemeval_s.py)

356 non-tuning questions. Post-stratified means re-weighted to the full 500-question category
mix, so neither arm is flattered by the holdout's sample.

| Arm | Raw | Post-stratified |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| No-memory | 0.0983 | 0.1095 |
| File-based | 0.4410 | 0.4491 |
| Oracle | 0.5618 | 0.5706 |
| **Structured** | **0.7303** | **0.7361** |

Paired difference, structured minus file-based: **+0.2869** post-stratified, McNemar discordant
134/31, exact p ≈ 1.8e-16.

**Where the gap sits, descriptively.** The oracle control answers with the file-based arm's
*entire* store in context and no search tools, so nothing saved can be missed. It lands between
the two arms, splitting the aggregate gap **+0.1215 (42%) on the read side and +0.1654 (58%) on
the write side**. Read this as an aggregate split, not a per-question identification: the
interventions are non-monotonic (oracle-versus-file rescued 52 and lost 9; structured-versus-
oracle rescued 94 and lost 34), and putting the whole directory in context also changes how the
reader sees it, not only what it can reach.

| Category | n | Structured | File-based |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Temporal-reasoning | 91 | 0.802 | 0.407 |
| Multi-session | 97 | 0.608 | 0.330 |
| Knowledge-update | 36 | 0.833 | 0.528 |
| Single-session-user | 52 | 0.923 | 0.673 |
| Single-session-assistant | 44 | 0.568 | 0.273 |
| Single-session-preference | 18 | 0.611 | 0.333 |
| **Abstention** | 18 | 0.778 | **0.889** |

Abstention, questions whose right answer is "I don't know", is the one category the file-based
arm wins, both here (0.889 vs 0.778) and in LoCoMo's adversarial category (0.508 vs 0.246). Same
mechanism both times: ranked retrieval nearly always surfaces *something* plausible enough to
tempt an answer, while a curation-limited store often has nothing to offer, so the model correctly
declines. Eager retrieval needs an abstention discipline bolted on; sparse memory gets one free.

**Cost**, dev-144, chat tokens per question. The two arms pay in different currencies, so
embedder tokens are never summed into the total.

| Chat tokens per question | File-based | Structured |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Writing memory (LLM curation) | 246,118 | 0 |
| Answering | 40,393 | 19,322 |
| **Total per question** | **286,512** | **19,322** |
| Total per *correct* answer | 665,447 | 27,013 |
| Embedder tokens (separate currency) | 0 | 107,797 |

The structured arm's zero on the write path is measured, not assumed: its ingest only embeds and
upserts, and a live query across the ingest window found no model-invoking jobs. Completion-token
counts are lower bounds throughout (hidden reasoning tokens are not always reported), and the two
currencies are never summed: an embedder token and a reasoning token are not the same thing.

### LongMemEval-M

[`scripts/longmemeval_m.py`](scripts/longmemeval_m.py)

The long-haystack variant, ~500-session histories. Both store-only arms ran on the same
100-question sample (seed 20260812; the drawn ids are published as
[`sample100_ids.json`](data/longmemeval_m/sample100_ids.json), and the study log records the draw
preceding both runs, though no public timestamped registration exists): one retrieval and one
reader call each, official per-question-type judging, so the comparison is paired.

| System | Score | Questions |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| **Hybrid (store-only)** | **0.750** | 100 (pre-drawn sample, seed 20260812) |
| Place-organized (MemPalace, store-only) | 0.600 | The same 100 |
| Hybrid (full agent loop) | 0.632 | 500 (complete set; different harness, directional only) |
| Entity-and-time (Graphiti OSS) | None | Ingest alone ≈ 600 single-stream GPU-days, or ≈ $7,000 hosted |

Paired McNemar on the store-only pair: rescued 22 / lost 7, exact two-sided **p = 0.008**, a
+15-point gap that clears the sample's CI95 of ±10. One reading discipline: the two arms differ
in more than place-plus-time structure (retrieval fusion, reranking, recency handling, atomic
facts against raw turns, embedder), so the supported claim is that **this hybrid implementation
beats this flat-store implementation at long histories**, where the same pair is
indistinguishable at LoCoMo's scale. That is consistent with structure paying as histories grow,
and the category shape points the same way (single-session categories swept 14/14 and 11/11,
wins concentrated in multi-session content), but the mechanism is not isolated from the bundle.

### LoCoMo

[`scripts/locomo.py`](scripts/locomo.py)

300 questions, stratified across the 10 conversations. Published under both scopes because
whether the adversarial category counts is itself disputed between vendors.

| Arm | All | Excluding adversarial |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| No-memory | 0.217 | 0.017 |
| File-based | 0.387 | 0.356 |
| **Structured** | **0.497** | **0.561** |

Structured minus file-based: **+0.110** all, **+0.205** excluding adversarial. Confidence
intervals resample whole conversations, not questions, because the questions cluster inside them:
structured, all questions, CI95 **[0.440, 0.553]**.

| Category | n | Structured | File-based |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Temporal | 62 | 0.694 | 0.306 |
| Temporal-inference | 54 | 0.519 | 0.259 |
| Open-domain | 61 | 0.656 | 0.410 |
| Single-hop | 62 | 0.371 | **0.435** |
| Adversarial | 61 | 0.246 | **0.508** |

Cost, ingest amortized per question: file-based **22.4k** chat tokens against structured
**11.6k**; per correct answer **58k** against **23k**.

### Store-only head-to-head

[`scripts/head_to_head.py`](scripts/head_to_head.py)

Every store stripped to its retrieval: its own top-20 for the same 1,540 non-adversarial LoCoMo
questions, one shared reader and judge (`gpt-4o-mini`, the model the graph vendor's own published numbers
were scored with), every store's row produced by the same script.

| Store | LoCoMo | LongMemEval-S | Median context |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Hybrid** | **0.7825** | **0.80** † | 4,048 chars |
| Place-organized (MemPalace) | 0.7792 | 0.60 † | 3,536 chars |
| Entity-and-time (Zep Cloud) | 0.7461 | Not run | 21,529 chars |
| Entity-and-time (Graphiti OSS) | 0.5338 | 0.35 | 7,857 chars |
| Entity-and-time (Graphiti, bge-m3) | 0.5286 | Not run | 7,896 chars |

† The LongMemEval-S column's Graphiti row (0.35) and the agent-loop row it is compared against
(0.72) reproduce from published rows (`scripts/longmemeval_s.py`); the hybrid store-only 0.80 and
MemPalace 0.60 do not, because those runs never persisted per-question contexts, and re-deriving
contexts now would pair answers with retrievals that did not produce them. Both scores carry that
caveat wherever they appear.

Paired McNemar over the same questions:

| Pair | Discordant | χ² | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Hybrid vs Zep Cloud | 188/132 | 9.45 | Significant, p < 0.01 |
| Place-organized vs Zep Cloud | 174/123 | 8.42 | Significant, p < 0.01 |
| Hybrid vs Place-organized | 141/136 | 0.06 | **Not significant** |
| Graphiti OSS vs bge-m3 | 216/208 | 0.12 | Not significant |
| Every store vs either Graphiti | 442–485 / 80–115 | 191–276 | Significant |

Two findings worth stating against interest. The first: the hybrid is **statistically
indistinguishable from a plain vector index** on LoCoMo (+0.3 points, paired CI95 [-1.8, +2.4],
recomputed by `head_to_head.py`): no detectable gain from place-plus-time there, with effects
beyond ~2 points in either direction excluded.

The second is that **on this benchmark the reader-and-judge stack outweighs every difference among
the stores that work** (the ordering inverts on [LongMemEval-M](#longmemeval-m), where the same
hybrid-versus-flat pair separates by 15 points). Evaluating byte-identical retrieval with the local
35B as both reader and judge scores 0.7130 instead of 0.7825; because both roles change together,
the 6.9 points belong to the evaluation stack as a whole, not to reader quality alone. Set that
swing beside the store gaps it is competing with:

| What changed | From | To | Points lost |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| **The reader+judge stack**, same retrieval | **`gpt-4o-mini` 0.7825** | **`Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-mxfp4` 0.7130** | **6.9** |
| The store, same reader | Hybrid 0.7825 | Place-organized 0.7792 | 0.3 |
| The store, same reader | Hybrid 0.7825 | Zep Cloud 0.7461 | 3.6 |
| The store, same reader | Place-organized 0.7792 | Zep Cloud 0.7461 | 3.3 |
| The embedder inside one store | Graphiti OSS 0.5338 | Graphiti bge-m3 0.5286 | 0.5 |
| The store, the *cheapest* route into the open engine | Zep Cloud 0.7461 | Graphiti OSS 0.5338 | 21.2 |

Read a row as: hold everything else fixed, change this one thing, and the score falls by that much.
Changing the reader-and-judge stack costs more than changing between any two of the three stores that
work. The only thing that costs more is dropping to Graphiti OSS, and the last row is the cheapest route there: the
other five store-to-Graphiti pairings cost 21.8 to 25.4. Three things sit behind these numbers and should not be
conflated:

- **The reader** answers from whatever context it receives. Identical for every store, which is
  what makes the store comparison valid; the 6.9-point row swaps it together with the judge.
- **The extractor** runs inside the store at ingest and decides what is ever written down. Part of
  the store being compared, not of the harness around it.
- **The pipeline** is what the extractor runs in: how many passes per message, what it resolves,
  what it keeps.

So which explains the 21 points between Zep Cloud and Graphiti OSS? Not the reader: it is the same
model for both. Not the extraction model's capability either, since the open engine ran with the same
class of extractor the vendor's published numbers were built with and still landed at 0.53. What is
left is everything the hosted service does around that extractor, and that is where this comparison
reaches the edge of what it can honestly claim. `head_to_head.py` recomputes the ranking itself, so
the ordering is derived rather than quoted.

**What this study cannot see.** Zep Cloud is a hosted product, and its row here is Zep's own published
context. What is measurable is what reaches the reader on each side, not the ingestion or ranking that
produced it. The open engine's contexts are visibly thinner, carrying fewer stored facts and much shorter
entity summaries, but that is a property of the released artifacts rather than a description of anyone's
internals. One known difference does not favour Zep: their published ingestion reads a `blip_captions`
key where the LoCoMo field is `blip_caption`
([zep-papers#9](https://github.com/getzep/zep-papers/issues/9)), dropping image captions that the runs
here kept.

None of this suggests their published number is wrong. It reproduces from their own released grades, and
their contexts re-scored under this study's reader and judge give 0.7461, within a point of their
published 75.14. The 21-point gap is real and reproducible; its cause is not observable from
outside. Read "the hosted pipeline" as a label for the unobserved remainder, not a mechanism
verified here.

### Cross-family judge audit

[`scripts/judge_audit.py`](scripts/judge_audit.py)

The head-to-head's judge could favour answers that resemble its own style, so an independent
frontier judge from a different vendor (`claude-sonnet-5`) re-judged all five stores' published
responses on a frozen 100-question sample. Recomputed here from the per-question rows: the
independent judge grades a uniform 4 to 7 points stricter, agreement is 0.91 to 0.96 with kappa
0.82 to 0.89 and a 0.05 agreement spread, and **every ranking is preserved**, with the hybrid's
win over Zep Cloud significant under the independent judge alone (21/8, p = 0.024) and the
hybrid-MemPalace tie holding. The supported claim is exactly that: rankings preserved on this
frozen sample. Equal agreement rates do not rule out directionally different errors per arm, and
the audit rows carry verdicts, not the independent judge's reasoning.

### Agentic benchmarks

[`scripts/agentic.py`](scripts/agentic.py)

Memory here is an experience bank: training-split episodes distilled into entries, retrieved
top-k into the acting model's prompt. Nothing is trained. "No memory" removes only the bank;
the harness scaffolding stays, so the ablation isolates retrieved memory.

| Actor | ALFWorld macro SR | WebShop score / SR |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Local 35B, no memory | 0.603 | 63.5 / 0.376 |
| Local 35B + bank | 0.645 | 66.0 / 0.418 |
| Frontier actor (`claude-sonnet-5`), no memory | 0.959 | 65.1 / 0.444 |
| Frontier actor + bank | 0.973 | 65.2 / 0.450 |
| MemHarness (GRPO-trained 7B), published | 0.852 / 0.859 OOD | 87.4 / 0.756 |

Paired ablations, memory rescued / cost:

| Column | Rescued | Cost | One-sided p | Two-sided p |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ALFWorld, 35B | 16 | 10 | 0.163 | 0.327 |
| ALFWorld, frontier | 2 | 0 | 0.250 | 0.500 |
| **WebShop, 35B** | **49** | **28** | **0.011** | **0.022** |
| WebShop, frontier | 33 | 30 | 0.401 | 0.801 |

One significant memory effect in the whole campaign, and it is the weak actor on WebShop.

The complementary probe runs the other direction: hold the *trained* system's frozen 7B actor
fixed on WebShop (full catalog, n=500) and swap what its memory holds.

| Arm (frozen trained 7B) | Score | SR |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| No memory | 71.0 | 0.300 |
| Its own released bank, its own retrieval semantics | 69.5 | 0.306 |
| The same bank, situation-match retrieval | 69.1 | 0.298 |

On strict success the three arms are statistically indistinguishable (all pairwise two-sided
p ≥ 0.52). On partial-credit score both memory arms are nominally *below* baseline (their bank
-1.5, CI95 [-3.1, +0.1]; situation-match -1.8, CI95 [-3.5, -0.1], exploratory), so "no effect" is
too kind to memory here, not too harsh. Scope, stated plainly: this port of the frozen actor
falls well short of the published baselines, so these rows establish that the tested injections
did not help *this port*; they cannot rule bank content or retrieval out of the *published*
system, and they do not identify the training as the cause. The training remains the leading
explanation via the system's own ablation (raw replay hurts its trained policy), which points the
same way from the trained side. The pattern that survives the whole study: **memory helped only
where the actor had headroom**; two actor tiers on two tasks, so a pattern, not a law.

## How to reproduce

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a40-labs/memory-bench
cd memory-bench
python3 scripts/verify_all.py          # every row-backed figure above, rebuilt and checked
python3 scripts/longmemeval_s.py       # or run one benchmark at a time
python3 systems/file-based/test_ccmem.py   # the file-based mechanism against its survey
```

No install step and no dependencies: standard library only, Python 3.9+. Every script exits
non-zero if any row-backed number fails to reproduce, so those results carry their own regression
test; the published scores without rows here are printed by the verifier as an explicit ledger. [`systems/file-based/`](systems/file-based) also ships a toy chatbot that runs the
file-based loop live against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint: chat, curate at session end, recall
in a fresh session.

Rows carry the per-question verdict, category, token counts, and (for the main-experiment
conversational arms) the model's answer and the gold answer, so that grading can be re-examined
and not merely re-tallied. The head-to-head rows are thinner: qa_id, verdict, hit count, and
retrieved-context *length*, not the contexts, questions, answers, or gold (see the provenance
note below); their shared judge prompt is published in
[`data/head_to_head/judge.json`](data/head_to_head/judge.json). The judge-audit rows carry the
two verdicts per question, not the independent judge's transcripts. In short: the head-to-head
and audit artifacts support re-tallying and re-deriving the statistics, not independent
re-judging.

### What these artifacts can and cannot settle

They verify the **result**, not the **system**. A third party can re-tally every score, inspect the
answers, and re-run the statistics. Every row is a single run, and the hosted reader is not
bit-deterministic at temperature 0: identical re-runs drifted 0.3 to 0.4 points, so the fourth
decimal is noise.

Rebuilding the systems is a separate matter. The structured, place-organized and entity-and-time
stores need memory services that are not in this repo. The file-based arm's mechanism is published
in `systems/file-based/`: enough to inspect or re-implement how memory was written, capped, aged
and searched, but the benchmark runner and its curation prompt stay unpublished: an auditable
specification of the arm, not a turnkey reproduction.

## Provenance and credit

**Zep Cloud's row is Zep's data, not ours.** Its retrieval contexts are the published outputs
from [`getzep/zep-papers`](https://github.com/getzep/zep-papers), used verbatim so their
production system speaks for itself. This repo publishes only *measurements over* that data
(per-question verdict, context length), never the contexts; fetch those from their repository
under their license. Their published result reproduces from their own artifacts; 0.7461 is the
same context re-scored under this comparison's shared reader and judge, a different number for a
stated reason rather than a contradiction of theirs.

**MemPalace** (MIT, [mempalace/mempalace](https://github.com/mempalace/mempalace)) is measured
through its own retrieval, read by the shared reader. Stated plainly, because a comparison should
describe a rival accurately: it stores conversation text verbatim, indexes it spatially (wings,
rooms, drawers), and ships a temporal entity graph with validity windows of its own. It publishes
per-question results and reproduction commands, the standard this repo is trying to meet. Its own
published numbers are retrieval recall (R@N), not QA accuracy; the 0.7792 here is its retrieval
read end-to-end by this comparison's reader and judge.

Also measured: [Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti), and
[MemHarness](https://github.com/KnowledgeXLab/MemHarness), whose ALFWorld and WebShop figures are
quoted from its paper. Benchmarks: [LongMemEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813),
[LoCoMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17753), [ALFWorld](https://alfworld.github.io/), and
[WebShop](https://webshop-pnlp.github.io/) (community mirror of the 1,000-product setting, the
official files being organization-locked).

## License

MIT, see [LICENSE](LICENSE). That covers the scripts and the result rows produced here. It does not
extend to third-party material this repository measures but does not contain: Zep Cloud's retrieval
contexts stay under [their repository's terms](https://github.com/getzep/zep-papers), and the
benchmarks themselves keep their own licenses.

## Caveats carried with every number

- **Single runs**, and the hosted reader is not bit-deterministic at temperature 0.
- **Graphiti OSS is a best-effort parity configuration** of the vendor's open-source engine, not their hosted product.
- **The file-based arm is a reconstruction** of a documented design, not a measurement of any
  shipping product; deviations are disclosed in the post, and several favour that arm.
- **One model family judged the main experiment.** An independent frontier judge audited the
  head-to-head stores and preserved every ranking (`scripts/judge_audit.py` recomputes it); the
  main experiment's file-versus-structured judge remains unaudited.
- **Consolidation never ran during a scored question**, so it contributed nothing to the scored
  numbers. Whether running it would raise or lower them is unmeasured: consolidation can merge
  usefully or lose information.
